# File-Permissions-in-Linux

In this project, I was able to check file and directory details and change file/directory permissions using Linux commands


<h2>Task 1: Check file and directory details</h2>

I began by navigating to the projects directory to review its contents and permissions. Within the directory, I identified four project folders, each containing text files, along with an additional subdirectory. I then examined the assigned permissions for each project and found that **Project_k** has read and write permissions granted to the User, Group, and Other users.

In this screenshot, you can see that there was a hidden file within the **Projects** directory named **.project_x.txt**


<h2>Task 2: Change file permissions</h2>
Here, we are to change the permissions of **project_k.txt** to remove its **write** permission so that the **Other** type doesn't have write permissions. While we are changing permissions, I also changed the permissions of **project_m.txt** so that it's no longer readable or writable by the **Group** or **Other** types.
