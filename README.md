# File-Permissions-in-Linux

In this project, I was able to check file and directory details and change file/directory permissions using Linux commands

I began by navigating to the projects directory to review its contents and permissions. Within the directory, I identified four project folders, each containing text files, along with an additional subdirectory. I then examined the assigned permissions for each project and found that **Project_k** has read and write permissions granted to the User, Group, and Other users.

In this screenshot, you can see that there was a hidden file within the **Projects** directory named **.project_x.txt**
