# File-Permissions-in-Linux

In this project, I was able to check file and directory details and change file/directory permissions using Linux commands


<h2>Task 1: Check file and directory details</h2>

I began by navigating to the projects directory to review its contents and permissions. Within the directory, I identified four project folders, each containing text files, along with an additional subdirectory. I then examined the assigned permissions for each project and found that **Project_k** has read and write permissions granted to the User, Group, and Other users.

In this screenshot, you can see that there was a hidden file within the **Projects** directory named **.project_x.txt**


<h2>Task 2: Change file permissions</h2>
In this step, the objective is to modify the permissions of project_k.txt by revoking its write permission for the Other user category. Additionally, while adjusting permissions, I also updated the permissions for project_m.txt, ensuring that it is no longer readable or writable by the Group and Other user categories.

In addition to revoking permissions, I also updated some permissions to the hidden project, giving both the User type and Group type only read permissions and removing any write permissions.
